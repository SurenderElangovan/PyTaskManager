Project Name: PyTaskManager

Description:
PyTaskManager is a command-line task manager written in Python. It provides users with a straightforward way to manage their tasks, including adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, listing all tasks, and deleting tasks.

Key Features:

Task Addition: Allow users to add tasks along with due dates and priorities.

Task Listing: Display a list of all tasks, showing details like task name, due date, and priority.

Task Completion: Provide an option to mark tasks as completed.

Task Deletion: Allow users to delete tasks they no longer need.

Priority Sorting: Implement a feature to sort tasks based on priority.

Data Persistence: Save tasks to a file so that users can access their task list across sessions.

User-Friendly Interface: Create a simple and intuitive command-line interface for a smooth user experience.

Tech Stack:

Python for the core functionality.
Use a lightweight database (such as SQLite) or simple file handling for data persistence.
Consider using a library like argparse for command-line argument parsing.
Example Usage:

# Add a new task
python pytaskmanager.py add "Finish project proposal" --due "2024-02-01" --priority high

# List all tasks
python pytaskmanager.py list

# Mark a task as completed
python pytaskmanager.py complete 1

# Delete a task
python pytaskmanager.py delete 2

Benefits:

Helps users organize and keep track of their tasks in a simple way.
Provides a lightweight, standalone solution without the need for a complex task management system.
Users can easily integrate PyTaskManager into their daily workflows through the command line.
